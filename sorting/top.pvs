%%%%% This library contains verifications of correctness and 
%%%%% completeness of sorting algorithms in PVS. Course projects 
%%%%% on Computational Logic for undergraduate computer science 
%%%%% students have been performed based on these libraries. 
%%%%% Popular sorting algorithms as bubblesort, quicksort, 
%%%%% mergesort, insertionsort and sorting by selection of  
%%%%% minimum and switching are verified in this library.
