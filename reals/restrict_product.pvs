% This theorem restrics the type of a product to the type of the its low and high bounds, assuming that
% low <= high and that both are in T. This results helps with proofs where of
% product[T1](low,high,F) = product[T2](low,high,F), where T1 and T2 are not exactly the same.
% In this case, restrict lemma can be used to brings both sides to the same type, where the
% lemma product_eq could be used.
