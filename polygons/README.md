# Polygons

Definitions and properties of 2D simple polygons.

Main contributions:
* vertices, edges and polygons with basic properties (see `polygons_2d.pvs`)
* definition of the topmost, leftmost vertex (see `topleft_vertex.pvs`)
* various attributes such as minimum separation distance (see `polygon_attributes.pvs`)
* edge crossings with a rightward horizontal ray (see `rightward_crossings.pvs`)
* reversing the vertex order of a polygon (see `reverse_polygons.pvs`)
* properties of the horizontal edge-crossing method for the point-in-polygon problem (see `horiz_edge_crossing.pvs`)
* properties of the arbitrary-direction edge-crossing method for the point-in-polygon problem see `arb_direc_edge_crossing.pvs`)
* miter point sequences applied to polygon vertices and edges (see `polygon_miter_sequences.pvs`)
* determining point membership in polygons plus edge containment properties (see `polygon_membership.pvs`)
