(1) created theory easy_menger.pvs which holds proof.
(2) removed importing menger from k_menger (to arrive at a minimal
    set of importings for this theory)
(3) moved "path_verts" from meng_scaff_defs.pvs to paths.pvs
(4) moved "adjacent" to graph_ops.pvs
(5) moved lemmas   walk?_subgraph and  path?_subgraph from meng_scaff_defs to new theory 
    subgraph_paths.pvs
(6) have decoupled new menger theorem from old version.
