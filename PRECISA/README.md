PRECISA (PVS Round-off Error Certifier vIa Static Analysis)
==

This directory contains the PVS code of the examples presented in the paper  _[Formally Certified Round-Off Error Analysis of Floating-Point Functions]_(https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/PRECISA/precisa_draft.pdf). PRECISA accepts as inputs functional expressions written in PVS format, e.g., [fluctuat](Fluctuat/fluctuat.pvs) and generates a round-off error certificate in the form of a PVS theory and its proofs, e.g., [fluctuat](Fluctuat/fluctuat.pvs)
